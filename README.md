## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to develop a software for the effective management of an online bookstore's database. The software is designed to be used by online shoppers. Customers can order books using the online store, and employees can easily update the website with new books and features.

#### Features:

1. The software includes a grouping procedure to organize information efficiently.

2. It has a function that counts the total number of records.

3. A procedure is available to determine the number of rows affected.

4. Our software has user-defined exceptions, which prevent the entry of book names that are less than 5 characters.
   
5. The software also features a trigger that shows the current number of rows in the table before inserting new data.

## PL/SQL

TODO: CODING PART
- Procedure which does group by information 
- Function which counts the number of records 
- Procedure which uses SQL%ROWCOUNT to determine the number of rows affected
- Add user-defined exception which disallows to enter title of item (e.g. book) to be less than 5 characters
- Create a trigger before insert on any entity which will show the current number of rows in the table
