## Introduction 📝

The main goal of this project is to develop a software for the effective management of an online bookstore's database 🪧. The software is designed to be used by online shoppers 🛍️. Customers can order books using the online store 📦, and employees can easily update the website with new books and features✨

#### Features:
1. The software includes a grouping procedure to organize information efficiently 👾
2. It has a function that counts the total number of records 🤖
3. A procedure is available to determine the number of rows affected 🔖
4. Our software has user-defined exceptions, which prevent the entry of book names that are less than 5 characters 👻
5. The software also features a trigger that shows the current number of rows in the table before inserting new data 📍
