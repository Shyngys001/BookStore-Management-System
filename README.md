## Introduction 📝

The main goal of this project is to develop a software for the effective management of an online bookstore's database 🪧. The software is designed to be used by online shoppers 🛍️. Customers can order books using the online store 📦, and employees can easily update the website with new books and features✨

#### Features:
1. The software includes a grouping procedure to organize information efficiently 👾
2. It has a function that counts the total number of records 🤖
3. A procedure is available to determine the number of rows affected 🔖
4. Our software has user-defined exceptions, which prevent the entry of book names that are less than 5 characters 👻
5. The software also features a trigger that shows the current number of rows in the table before inserting new data 📍

### What's new?
We have made some updates to our project. Firstly, we have transitioned all our data to a NoSQL format, specifically MongoDB. Additionally, we have implemented several queries tailored for MongoDB🍃 to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data within the repository. These queries ⚙️ have been specifically designed to optimize performance and enhance overall functionality. Below, you will find a list of queries.👇

## Queries:
### 1. Show all customers who have written reviews.
```js
db.customers.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: 'reviews',
      localField: '_id',
      foreignField: 'customer_id',
      as: 'reviews'
    }
  },
  {
    $match: {
      reviews: { $exists: true, $ne: [] }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 1,
      name: 1
    }
  }
])

```

### 2. Print the minimum and maximum prices of books.
```js
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      minPrice: { $min: '$price' },
      maxPrice: { $max: '$price' }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      minPrice: 1,
      maxPrice: 1
    }
  }
])
```
### 3. Print name and salary of Frontend employees.
```js
db.employees.find(
  {title: "Frontend Developer"}, 
  {_id: 0}
)
```


Feel free to explore these queries and utilize them to interact with our MongoDB database effectively.<br>
